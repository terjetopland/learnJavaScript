# learnJavaScript
I will learn Javascript better.

## Reason
Since I've started my studies on the University we have jumped from one language to another. I've always felt that I should learn a specific language better. 
The reason for choosing Javascript is based on the knowledge that this is used widely around and it should be easier to dive into other languages with the core concepts of JS.
